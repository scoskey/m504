## Course description

Math 387 is a successor to Math 187/189 and Math 287. We will continue our study of topics in discrete math using a proof-based approach. The material we cover will include methods of counting, graph theory, and counting using generating functions. At the same tmie we will strive to improve on our investigative powers, our proof-writing ability, and our appreciation for mathematical methods and beauty.

### Anticipated learning outcomes

* Possess and exhibit a working knowledge of number theory content
* Read and write proofs in number theory
* Appreciate abstract mathematics, number theory, and its applications

### Rough plan

* Weeks 1-3: Divisibility and congruences
* Weeks 4-7: Primes and primality testing
* Week 8: Primitive roots
* Week 9: Review and midterm exam
* Weeks 10-12: Quadratic reciprocity, Pell's equation
* Weeks 13-14: Diophantine approximation, continued fractions
* Weeks 15-16: Review and final exam

### Course format

The course will be delivered through synchronous remote class sessions. Each session will include a mixture of questions on previous material, discussion of new material, and in-class problem solving.

## Grading

### Attendance, participation, and classwork 10%

You are expected to attend remote class sessions, and to be prepared to ask questions and discuss the material. Following the discussion, we will sometimes work on homework problems in small groups. A portion of your grade will be based on your attendance, preparedness, attention, and collaboration.

### Homework 50%

Homework will be assigned each week and collected the following week. Most exercises will be graded for both correcteness and mathematical style. Some will be graded for completeness only. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers, and you are welcome to use online resources when you are stuck (please reference). But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.

Students enrolled in Math 504 may occasionally be asked to complete additional problems.

### Take-home exams 25% x2

Take-home exams will be given during the 9th week and the finals week of the class.

Students enrolled in Math 504 may be asked to complete additional problems.


## Disclaimer

This syllabus is subject to change. I may make refinements and updates during the first few weeks of the semester. While I don't expect any substantial changes, please allow for some flexibility. I will give notice before making any changes to the syllabus.
